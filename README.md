# Data-Cleaning-Project
Data Cleaning With pandas and NumPy

Data scientists spend a large amount of their time cleaning datasets so that they’re easier to
work with. In fact, the 80/20 rule says that the initial steps of obtaining and cleaning data
account for 80% of the time spent on any given project.

So, if you’re just stepping into this field or planning to step into this field, it’s important to
be able to deal with messy data, whether that means missing values, inconsistent
formatting, malformed records, or nonsensical outliers.
Leverage Python’s pandas and NumPy libraries to clean data.

Complete the following tasks:
- Dropping unnecessary columns in a DataFrame
- Changing the index of a DataFrame
-  Using .str() methods to clean columns
-  Renaming columns to a more recognizable set of labels
-  Skipping unnecessary rows in a CSV file
